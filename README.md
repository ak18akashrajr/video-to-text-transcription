# YouTube Video to Text Transcription

This Python script allows users to convert YouTube video content into text by downloading the video, extracting its audio, and transcribing it using speech recognition.

---

## Features
- Downloads YouTube videos using `yt-dlp`.
- Extracts audio from the downloaded video.
- Transcribes the audio into text using Google Speech Recognition API.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - `yt-dlp`
  - `moviepy`
  - `speechrecognition`

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install yt-dlp moviepy speechrecognition
```

---

## How It Works
1. The script downloads the specified YouTube video using `yt-dlp`.
2. The videoâ€™s audio is extracted and saved as a temporary `.wav` file.
3. The extracted audio is processed using the Google Speech Recognition API to generate text.
4. The transcribed text is saved to a specified output file.

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Run the script with a YouTube video URL and desired output file path.

### Example:
```python
youtube_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"  # Replace with your YouTube video URL
output_text_file_path = "transcribed_text.txt"  # Replace with your desired output file path

youtube_video_to_text(youtube_url, output_text_file_path)
```

### Output:
The transcription will be saved in `transcribed_text.txt` or the specified output file.

## Notes
- The `yt-dlp` library is used for downloading videos as it is more reliable than `pytube`.
- The Google Speech Recognition API requires an active internet connection.
- Accuracy may vary depending on the audio quality and language.

---

## Potential Improvements
- Support for multiple languages using advanced APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or AWS Transcribe).
- Chunk-based transcription for handling longer videos.
- Integration with a GUI or web-based interface for easier use.
